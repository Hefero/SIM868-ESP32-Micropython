# RP2040 SIM868 Micropython Library


- __SIM868L.py__: a pure-MicroPython driver for the SIM868 GPRS module with both HTTP(S) GET and POST support. Works out of the box on the [RP2040-SIM868](https://www.robotics.org.za/#). 

Example usage of HTTP is in the example_SIM868.py script, just set the APN and change the pins if needed, then run the "example_usage" function.

Example usage of GPS is in the gps_example.py script, run the "example_usage" function.

Example usage of SMS is in the sms_example.py script, run the "example_usage" function.

## How to use

- [Tutorial on getting started with the RP2040 and MicroPython](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/2) from **Install Thonny** to **Blink the onboard LED** is the most relavant.
- Save/upload the SIM868.py file to the [RP2040-SIM868](https://www.robotics.org.za/#).
- Save/upload one of the example file or create your own script.

Modem.disconnect()
```
### Brief
Disconnect from the GPRS network.

---
``` python
Modem.http_request(url, mode='GET', data=None, content_type='application/json')
```
### Brief
Send a HTTP request via the GPRS network.
### Note
Only support for GET and POST method at this time.
### Params
- **url**: URL to send the HTTP Request too.
